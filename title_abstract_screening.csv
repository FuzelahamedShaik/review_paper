COVID-19 and Future Disease X in Circular Economy Transition: Redesigning Pandemic Preparedness to Prevent a Global Disaster,Cristina Possas; Ernesto T. A. Marques; João Baptista Risi; Akira Homma,"The COVID-19 pandemic exposed a world surprisingly unprepared to respond to the new epidemiological scenario, even the developed countries, in spite of warnings from scientists since the 1990s. These alerts warned on the risks of an exponential increase in emergence of potentially pandemic zoonotic infectious diseases related to disruptive ecological niches in different regions of the globe, such as H1N1 Influenza, SARS, MERS, Zika, avian flu, swine flu, and Ebola, and also on the risks of a future and more lethal Disease X. We examine this global public health failure in anticipating and responding to the pandemic, stressing the urgent need for an innovative global pandemic preparedness system in the current transition from linear economy to a circular economy. Evidence provided here indicates that this novel preventive-based and resource-saving preparedness system could contribute to reverse the detrimental impacts of the pandemic on global economy and increase its resilience. Individual protection, contact tracing, and lockdown have proved to be just partially effective to respond to the spillover of viral zoonosis into the human population, and for most of these pathogens, vaccines are not yet available. As for COVID-19 vaccines, in spite of the extraordinary investments and unprecedented advances in innovative vaccines in few months, most of these products are expected to be available to more vulnerable developing countries’ populations only by mid-2022. Furthermore, even when these vaccines are available, constraints such as low efficacy, waning immunity, new concerning COVID-19 variants, adverse events, and vaccine hesitancy might possibly restrict their public health impact and could contribute to aggravate the pandemic scenario. Considering these constraints and the severe global economic and social crises resulting from the lack of adequate preparedness and delayed effective response to COVID-19 and possibly to a future Disease X, we propose a pro-active global eco-social pandemic preparedness system. This novel system, based on One Health paradigm and on artificial intelligence and machine learning, is expected to incorporate “spillover” foresight and management into global preparedness and timely response. Designed to mitigate damage from outbreaks and minimize human morbidity and mortality, this approach to pandemic foresight and preparedness will be key to prevent a global disaster.",,28-06-2021,,,,,,,,#689,,"",""
Social Media as Amedium of Crisis Communication Amongst University Campuses in Kisii County,"","Social media gives the ability to communicate quickly and effectively, revolutionizing the manner in which people communicate and gather information about stories and topics that are of interest to them. With the right tools in place, social media can play an important role in crisis communication. The use of social media in crisis communication has become common in the current digital age. The manifestation of social media usage is in the rapid growth and popularity of such social media platforms such as facebook, bandoo, flicker, twitter and whatsApp. As such this paper examined the applications of social media platforms in crisis communication in university management. The analysis targeted employees from different university campuses in Kisii County. The study sampled 108 employees of university campuses in Kisii County. Quantitative data that was collected were analyzed using descriptive statistics while qualitative data was examined and reported basing on various themes. Data indicated that various social media platforms are in use by the university campuses in their crisis communication. Whatsapp was noted to be the most used social media by the university campuses in Kisii County. As a tool for mobile devices, WhatsApp has several capabilities such as portability, ability to share several message formats such as graphics and geographical location, ability to send voice notes and ability to broadcast one message to many recipients. This makes it attractive to the majority of the users.

986 A Systematic Review of Medical Student Willingness to Volunteer and Preparedness for Pandemics and Disasters,"","Abstract Introduction We aimed to identify motivators and barriers to volunteering during a disaster and knowledge and medical school curriculum of disaster and pandemic medicine. Method We systematically searched the literature on 28/6/2020, following PRISMA guidelines. Results A total of 37 studies met inclusion criteria including 11,168 medical students and 91 medical schools. 24 studies evaluated knowledge (64.9%), 16 evaluated volunteering (43.2%), and five evaluated medical school curricula (13.5%). Weighted mean willingness to volunteer during a disaster was 68.4% (SD = 21.7%, n = 2911), and there was a significant difference between those planning to volunteer and those who actually volunteered (P&amp;lt;.001). We identified a number of modifiable barriers which may contribute to this difference. Overall, knowledge of disasters was poor with a weighted mean of 48.9% (SD = 15.1%, n = 2985). Conclusions There is a large number of students who are willing to volunteer during pandemics. However, they are likely to be under-prepared for these roles due to poor overall knowledge and limited teaching. During the current COVID-19 pandemic and in future disasters, medical students may be required to volunteer as auxiliary staff. Medical schools need to develop infrastructure to facilitate this process as well as providing education and training to ensure students are adequately prepared for these roles.",,01-05-2021,,,,,,,,#728,,"",""

The Spread of COVID-19 Crisis Communication by German Public Authorities and Experts on Twitter: Quantitative Content Analysis (Preprint),"","<sec> <title>BACKGROUND</title> The COVID-19 pandemic led to the necessity of immediate crisis communication by public health authorities. In Germany, as in many other countries, people choose social media, including Twitter, to obtain real-time information and understanding of the pandemic and its consequences. Next to authorities, experts such as virologists and science communicators were very prominent at the beginning of German Twitter COVID-19 crisis communication. </sec> <sec> <title>OBJECTIVE</title> The aim of this study was to detect similarities and differences between public authorities and individual experts in COVID-19 crisis communication on Twitter during the first year of the pandemic. </sec> <sec> <title>METHODS</title> Descriptive analysis and quantitative content analysis were carried out on 8251 original tweets posted from January 1, 2020, to January 15, 2021. COVID-19\xe2\x80\x93related tweets of 21 authorities and 18 experts were categorized into structural, content, and style components. Negative binomial regressions were performed to evaluate tweet spread measured by the retweet and like counts of COVID-19\xe2\x80\x93related tweets. </sec> <sec> <title>RESULTS</title> Descriptive statistics revealed that authorities and experts increasingly tweeted about COVID-19 over the period under study. Two experts and one authority were responsible for 70.26% (544,418/774,865) of all retweets, thus representing COVID-19 influencers. Altogether, COVID-19 tweets by experts reached a 7-fold higher rate of retweeting (&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;8,249&lt;/sub&gt;=26.94, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;.001) and 13.9 times the like rate (&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;8,249&lt;/sub&gt;=31.27, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;.001) compared with those of authorities. Tweets by authorities were much more designed than those by experts, with more structural and content components; for example, 91.99% (4997/5432) of tweets by authorities used hashtags in contrast to only 19.01% (536/2819) of experts\xe2\x80\x99 COVID-19 tweets. Multivariate analysis revealed that such structural elements reduce the spread of the tweets, and the incidence rate of retweets for authorities\xe2\x80\x99 tweets using hashtags was approximately 0.64 that of tweets without hashtags (&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;=\xe2\x80\x936.92, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;.001). For experts, the effect of hashtags on retweets was insignificant (&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;=1.56, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;=.12). </sec> <sec> <title>CONCLUSIONS</title> Twitter data are a powerful information source and suitable for crisis communication in Germany. COVID-19 tweet activity mirrors the development of COVID-19 cases in Germany. Twitter users retweet and like communications regarding COVID-19 by experts more than those delivered by authorities. Tweets have higher coverage for both authorities and experts when they are plain and for authorities when they directly address people. For authorities, it appears that it was difficult to win recognition during COVID-19. For all stakeholders studied, the association between number of followers and number of retweets was highly significantly positive (authorities &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;=28.74, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;.001; experts &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;=25.99, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;.001). Updated standards might be required for successful crisis communication by authorities. </sec>",,06-07-2021,,,,,,,,#736,,"",""

RESCUE: A Resilient and Secure Device-to-Device Communication Framework for Emergencies,"","During disasters, existing telecommunication infrastructures are often congested or even destroyed. In these situations, mobile devices can form a backup communication network for civilians and emergency services using disruption-tolerant networking (DTN) principles. Unfortunately, such distributed and resource-constrained networks are particularly susceptible to a wide range of attacks such as terrorists trying to cause more harm. In this paper, we present RESCUE, a resilient and secure device-to-device communication framework for emergency scenarios that provides comprehensive protection against common attacks. RESCUE features a minimalistic DTN protocol that, by design, is secure against notable attacks such as routing manipulations, dropping, message manipulations, blackholing, or impersonation. To further protect against message flooding and Sybil attacks, we present a twofold mitigation technique. First, a mobile and distributed certificate infrastructure particularly tailored to the emergency use case hinders the adversarial use of multiple identities. Second, a message buffer management scheme significantly increases resilience against flooding attacks, even if they originate from multiple identities, without introducing additional overhead. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of RESCUE via large-scale simulations in a synthetic as well as a realistic natural disaster scenario. Our simulation results show that RESCUE achieves very good message delivery rates, even under flooding and Sybil attacks.",,09-11-2020,,,,,,,,#741,,"",""
Crisis Communication Patterns in Social Media during Hurricane Sandy,"","Hurricane Sandy was one of the deadliest and costliest of hurricanes of the past few decades. Many states experienced significant power outage; however, many people used social media to communicate while having limited or no access to traditional information sources. Using machine learning techniques, this study explored the evolution of various communication patterns and determined user concerns that emerged over the course of Hurricane Sandy. The original data included \xe2\x88\xbc52M tweets coming from \xe2\x88\xbc13M users between October 14, 2012 and November 12, 2012. A topic model was run on \xe2\x88\xbc763K tweets from the top 4,029 most frequent users who tweeted about Sandy at least 100 times. Some 250 well-defined communication patterns based on perplexity were identified. Conversations of the most frequent and relevant users indicate the evolution of numerous storm-phase (warning, response, and recovery) specific topics. People were also concerned about storm location and time, media coverage, and activities of political leaders and celebrities. Also presented is each relevant keyword that contributed to one particular pattern of user concerns. Such keywords would be particularly meaningful in targeted information-spreading and effective crisis communication in similar major disasters. Each of these words can also be helpful for efficient hash-tagging to reach the target audience as needed via social media. The pattern recognition approach of this study can be used in identifying real-time user needs in future crises.",,30-05-2018,,,,,,,,#742,,"",""
A discussion of damage mitigation of natural disasters: How to increase citizens' preparedness,"","It is widely recognised that community-wide support and learning is important to ensure that people are adequately prepared for natural disasters. To enhance preparedness of citizens, a critical theme is how to utilise the benefit of information Communication Technology (ICT) in the scheme of ICT-based learning programmes to raise citizens' perceptions of disaster risk and how to enable citizens to be ready for the future disasters. And in so doing, collaboration with the public sector, local disaster management NPOs and other stakeholders would be important topic. However, for such training programmes to be meaningful is important that they are based on citizens' sense of urgency about all aspects of disasters and a clear understanding by policy makers of what elements should be prioritised in the programme. This study first recognises the existence of a gap between citizens' perceptions of the real and the virtual scape of natural disasters, and then, based on data from a survey of citizens' attitudes in X city in Japan, quantitatively captures the factors and elements of disasters that influence citizens' perceptions of city resilient, and suggests implications for policy makers and relevant stakeholders. The results will be presented to policy makers and stakeholders. This is expected to provide models and scales of analysis for ICT implementation in disaster prevention and mitigation, i.e. coping with natural disasters brought about by climate change.",,15-11-2021,,,,,,,,#745,,"",""

Design/methodology/approach \xe2\x80\x93 The article is based on earlier research and secondary data (an extensive assessment made by the Norwegian police authority in 2012), as well as a minor media analysis focusing on representation of the perpetrator. An interview with two high-ranking communication officials working for the crisis management coordination secretariat in Norway has served as supplementary material. Findings \xe2\x80\x93 The crisis challenged the linear process of standard planning and information transmission. The terrorist attacks in Norway and how they were framed, especially before the perpetrator was identified, are linked to a global discourse on terrorists, and demonstrate the need for developing specific terrorism crisis communication theory. The news media coverage gave the perpetrator and his political messages publicity, but more as a lone disturbed individual, associated with school shootings more than with terrorism. There is a need for increased knowledge about terrorism as strategic communication or public relations.

The FEMS framework was modified to apply to earthquakes. Leveraging a multiple explanatory case study approach with data analysis, the authors reconstructed the events of the earthquakes in Pakistan (2005) and Japan (2011) with an applied grading (1\xe2\x80\x935). Findings were evaluated within the adopted FEMS framework. From a practitioner\xe2\x80\x99s perspective, the framework is applicable and can accelerate support in the field. Findings Pakistan lacked emergency plans before the 2005 earthquake. In contrast, Japan possessed emergency plans before the disaster, helping minimise casualties. Overall, Japan demonstrated considerably better emergency management effectiveness. However, both countries significantly lacked the distribution of responsibilities among actors. Originality/value Practical factors in the humanitarian supply chain are well understood. However, synthesising individual factors into a comprehensive framework is difficult, which the study solves by applying and adopting the FEMS framework to earthquakes.

The results showed a coordinated and persistent effort to inform the public with credible, accurate, timely and empowering information. The most persistent priority of the government was to control the spread of the virus, while several issues relating to the socio-economic wellbeing of the people were prioritised at different stages of the pandemic. There was a parallel movement between the trajectory of the disease and government decisions, suggesting that government response was mostly reactive to the behaviour of the pandemic.

Science Communication in Times of Crisis,"","This volume addresses demands on external and internal science communication in times of crisis. The contributions discuss present crises such as COVID-19 (e.g. vaccination campaigns or political reactions towards the pandemic in the context of science scepticism), and climate change (e.g. plausibility judgements or the role of scientists). They also relate their approaches to past crises, e.g. 9/11 or the Galileo affair. This volume is unique in that it is interdisciplinary from a theoretical and methodological perspective. In that respect, the authors apply concepts from corpus linguistics, discourse analysis, rhetoric, news values analysis, pragmatics and terminology research to various types of data, such as newspaper headlines, Tweets, open letters, corpora or glossaries. The case studies are situated within different cultural contexts, with various languages being examined, i.e. Polish, Arabic, English, French, German, and Spanish. Elevating our understanding of the interface of science communication and crisis communication, this collection of articles proves valuable to scholars and students from linguistics, communication science, political science, sociology and philosophy of science.",,18-07-2022,,,,,,,,#793,,"",""
A retrospective review of the development and application of crisis and emergency risk communication (CERC) in social media (Preprint),"","<sec> <title>BACKGROUND</title> Crisis and emergency risk communication (CERC) has been proposed as a way for government and public health organizations to improve their ability to connect with the public via social media while also integrating risk communication and crisis communication. However, few studies have systematically analyzed how CERC can be integrated with social media. </sec> <sec> <title>OBJECTIVE</title> Exploring the application of CERC in social media, comparing the distribution of platforms, the types and forms of data, the primary methods used, and clearer understanding of the main contributions and developmental context of CERC. </sec> <sec> <title>METHODS</title> We used the Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed as databases to conduct a retrospective review with ""Crisis and Emergency Risk Communication"" as the search term from 2005 to 2021. Then, CERC was quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed. In the first part, we consider quantitative analysis as the core and publications as the research object, comprehensively covering the publication distribution in terms of time, periodical, country, institution, author, and discipline. In the second part, we use qualitative analysis to explore the composition of research topics related to keywords and the temporal variation trend of research topics based on keywords. The third part focuses on exploring the combination of CERC and social media. Finally, we propose future research routes based on the above results. </sec> <sec> <title>RESULTS</title> Health Promotion Practice is the most productive journal with seven contributing publications. The USA has become the dominant player in this field, with a considerable advantage of 28 publications. Australia, China, and the UK are far behind USA's contribution, although they are the second highest contributors. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is the most contributing organization with three publications. Only seven people published more than two articles at the author level, among whom Lu, J. is from China, while Reynolds, B. and the other five are all from the United States. The cluster results show that the researchers mainly focus on five categories of issues: prevention and control of infectious diseases, disaster planning of bioterrorism, social media's role in risk and crisis communication, medical intervention in risk perception, the role of Twitter in public health crises. </sec> <sec> <title>CONCLUSIONS</title> We raise some future concerns based on the use case of CERC in social media. First, existing research has focused too much on Twitter and may have overlooked the role of Facebook. Second, existing studies have focused on only one side of the government (organization) or the public, and have not considered the effectiveness of government or organizational communication strategies as assessed by public response. Third, the methodologies for studying tweets must be updated. Fourth, the research on false information in the precrisis stage must improve. Finally, the information forms of crisis communication of governments or organizations must be enriched. </sec>",,23-07-2022,,,,,,,,#795,,"",""

"Communication, Leadership, and Organizational Skills in Emergency Response","","The development of timely and effective emergency management (EM) systems has become increasingly attractive, the primary aim of which is to help and enable emergency managers to prepare for disasters and respond to urgent events. The EM system\xe2\x80\x99s general framework comprises a series of decision-making problems in three phases: pre-event forecasting and preparation, in-event response and evacuation, and post-event recovery, which reflect the leadership competencies required during and post-times of crisis and the roles envisioned to support their respective organizations. However, the communication issues, primarily technological-based, uncovered the need to understand how leaders collect, disseminate, and adapt critical information through understanding crisis type and community needs. Additionally, the emergence of intelligence EM systems emphasizes learning from previous experiences when a new emergency occurs by analyzing historical data of similar events or scenarios to provide improved forecasts for affected areas, populations, and, precisely, the demand for relief resources. Furthermore, the rapid progress of big data, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and the Internet of Things (IoT) permits the development of a prediction system for emergency occurrence and resource demand, thereby improving communication between leaders, agencies, and community members. The capabilities of AI techniques to make full use of acquired data and deal with imprecise or uncertain information are widely recognized, especially in forecasting the occurrence of emergency events and evaluating their impacts on the economy and society. Therefore, improving the existing emergency preparedness for a more robust emergency response and the effects accumulated remains ideal.",,01-01-2023,,,,,,,,#804,,"",""

The analysis compares the initial phase of crisis communication. A serious communication crisis arose between the authorities and the public after Chernobyl, while communication during the early days after 22 July was successful. The difference is explained by the concept of rationality; crisis communication after Chernobyl was based on technical rationality, whereas communication after the terror attacks was grounded on the rationality of caring.

Disaster preparedness in humanitarian logistics: A collaborative approach for resource management in floods,"","The logistical deployment of resources to provide relief to disaster victims and the appropriate planning of these activities are critical to reduce the suffering caused. Disaster management attracts many organisations working alongside each other and sharing resources to cope with an emergency. Consequently, successful operations rely heavily on the collaboration of different organisations. Despite this, there is little research considering the appropriate management of resources from multiple organisations, and none optimising the number of actors required to avoid shortages or convergence. This research introduces a disaster preparedness system based on a combination of multi-objective optimisation and geographical information systems to aid multi-organisational decision-making. A cartographic model is used to avoid the selection of floodable facilities, informing a bi-objective optimisation model used to determine the location of emergency facilities, stock prepositioning, resource allocation and relief distribution, along with the number of actors required to perform these activities. The real conditions of the flood of 2013 in Acapulco, Mexico, provided evidence of the inability of any single organisation to cope with the situation independently. Moreover, data collected showed the unavailability of enough resources to manage a disaster of that magnitude at the time. The results highlighted that the number of government organisations deployed to handle the situation was excessive, leading to high cost without achieving the best possible level of satisfaction.

The full terms of this licence may be seen at http://creativecommons.org/licences/by/4.0/legalcode Introduction Terrorist attacks have become an unwanted but increasingly common type of crisis situation. Fifty-five per cent of all terrorist attacks with more than 50 casualties that have been carried out throughout the world during the last 100 years have occurred since 2007. 1 Countries such as Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Syria frequently have to deal with such massive acts of terror, while the attacks in Nice in 2016 (84 casualties), Paris in 2015 (137 casualties), Ankara in 2015 (102 casualties) and Oslo and Ut\xc3\xb8ya in 2011 (77 casualties) are examples of how such massive terrorist attacks have also become frequent in Europe. Massive terrorist attacks represent a type of crisis situation which is complex and chaotic, and in which it is extremely important to acquire as quickly as possible what Endsley (1995) has called situation awareness (SA). Efficient and accurate communication is the key to SA, and authorities such as the police, emergency personnel, fire departments, etc., need to have efficient communication with each other, with governmental officers and other public bodies, the media and the public, in order to establish SA for all parties. Adding to the complexity of such crisis situations and the challenges of communication they create is the fact that the past decade has seen the emergence of what Bruns (2014, p. 351) has called \xe2\x80\x98a new ecology of emergency media\xe2\x80\x99, in which social media play an ever more important role. The authorities have been slow to implement social media in their crisis communication strategies (Hornmoen et al., 2018; Perng et al., 2012). There is a need for more knowledge on what role social media can play during crisis situations such as severe terrorist attacks, so that the authorities and others (NGOs, journalists, those targeted, etc.) can become better equipped to acquire and share SA. This chapter presents some recommendations for the authorities and others on the uses and functions of social media during severe terrorist attacks, based on an analysis of social media activity during the 22 July 2011 attacks in Oslo and on Ut\xc3\xb8ya. 2 The chapter briefly presents the analysed data, the theoretical framework of SA as it relates to social media and crisis communication and the key findings of the case study, before concluding with the main recommendations for the authorities in particular on how to deal with social media in a crisis situation such as a severe terrorist attack. Situation Awareness and Social Media in Crisis Communication A key communicative challenge during a crisis event is to achieve adequate SA for all parties: those directly affected, official crisis management and response institutions, journalistic institutions, NGOs and other institutions and the public. Endsley (1995, p. 36) defines SA as \xe2\x80\x98the perception of the elements in the environment within a volume of time and space, the comprehension of their meaning, and the projection of their status in the near future\xe2\x80\x99. SA is, in other words, being aware of what is going on at a given time and in a given space; how to understand it, and how to act on that knowledge immediately and properly. Mundane and everyday activities such as walking and driving require constant SA, as do many other activities in a wide array of environments. However, it is in complex and changing situations \xe2\x80\x93 like a sudden crisis \xe2\x80\x93 that SA becomes difficult to acquire, according to Endsley (1995, p. 33). Achieving and maintaining SA is a process involving a lot of \xe2\x80\x98situational assessment\xe2\x80\x99 (Endsley, 1995, p. 36), and it is in this process of assessment that social media can play a crucial role in a crisis. Social media are potentially an \xe2\x80\x98awareness system\xe2\x80\x99 (Maireder & Ausserhofer, 2014) that can engage citizens in crowdsourcing information activities; they thereby take on importance in disseminating emergency alerts, in citizens\xe2\x80\x99 self-organisation of local responses to a crisis and, ultimately, in how a crisis situation is assessed. Social media do, however, make the acquisition of SA more complex, as the process becomes networked instead of individual and more improvisational (Mendon\xc3\xa7a, 2007). Perng et al. (2012, p. 9) argue that the theory of SA does not sufficiently take into account \xe2\x80\x98how awareness is developed and updated through distributed collaboration by those who are situated in very different socio-technological circumstances, and how this is a matter of \xe2\x80\x9cconfiguring awareness\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99. Viewing the acquisition of SA as a networked collaboration, in which awareness is configured through joint efforts, is important for fully understanding how crisis communication functions in social media. It is not enough for key communicators in official crisis management and response institutions to send out an official statement in a tweet, a Facebook update or similar. They need to understand how that message is disseminated within social networks, what is required for its proper dissemination, how people in different socio-technical contexts might receive and interpret the message and also expect feedback in the form of questions, worries and possible updates. All this requires participation and interaction on a completely different level than in other mass media channels of communication. Furthermore, awareness configuration is not something which is transferred from one person or institution to another in social media. It is a many-to-many process, in which official crisis management and response institutions, journalistic institutions and others are parts of a larger network to which they need to listen in order to acquire and maintain SA themselves. The Norwegian Twitter-sphere during the 22 July 2011 terrorist attack is a good example of how this many-to-many awareness configuration might work (see Chapter 1 in this volume). As analysed by Ottosen (2015) and in Chapter 3 in this volume, this process is difficult if crisis authorities do not participate in social media. Key communicators in official crisis management and response institutions, and to an extent, journalists too, are lagging behind in dealing with this networked, collaborative way of creating SA, according to Perng et al. (2012). Research has shown how members of the public might use social media to organise help and respond to a crisis (Perng et al., 2012; Starbird & Palen, 2011); such efforts might be important in the general assessment of a crisis situation. About the Case and the Data On Friday 22 July 2011 at 15.25 a massive car bomb exploded in the government quarter in the centre of Oslo. Eight people were killed in the blast, which left neighbouring quarters resembling a war zone. The national newspaper VG, the regional newspaper Dagsavisen and the commercial broadcaster TV 2, which all had offices close to the government quarter, had to evacuate their premises due to the bomb blast. The lone terrorist, Anders Behring Breivik \xe2\x80\x93 a 28-year-old right-wing extremist who wanted to attack the social democratic party, whom he regarded as traitors to Norway \xe2\x80\x93 then drove 38 km northwest of Oslo to the Tyrifjorden lake, where, dressed as a policeman, he arrived at the ferry landing Ut\xc3\xb8yakaia at 16.55. He was transported by local ferry to the small island of Ut\xc3\xb8ya, where the social democratic party\xe2\x80\x99s youth organisation (AUF) was holding its traditional, annual week-long summer camp. A total of 564 people were on the island when Breivik arrived at 17.18. For more than an hour, he searched the island for people to kill; he was able to kill 69 people, mostly adolescents, and severely injure 56 before being apprehended by the police at 18.34. Many youngsters fled the island by swimming away, while others hid as best they could (Dyb et al., 2014). At 19.30, the police confirmed that seven people had been killed by the bomb. At 21.30, the police reported 10 deaths on Ut\xc3\xb8ya. At 22.45, the minister of Justice, Knut Storberget, confirmed that the apprehended terrorist was ethnically Norwegian. At 03.17 on 23 July, the police stated that the number of causalities on Ut\xc3\xb8ya was far greater than previously presumed, and at 03.50, they reported that 80 people had been killed on Ut\xc3\xb8ya. The correct number of casualties was not announced until Monday 25 July. The 22 July commission, appointed by parliament to investigate how the Norwegian authorities handled the crisis, concluded that the damage done by the terrorist could have been considerably minimised, had the police and other authorities been better coordinated, and in possession of better communication routines (NOU, 2012; see also Chapter 4 in this volume). The commission also commented on the role of social media during the crisis: Never before have the members of government personally received information by text messages, telephone calls and social media directly from victims, at the same time as they were supposed to be dealing with a national crisis. (NOU, 2012, p. 454) Some of the youngsters trapped on Ut\xc3\xb8ya used Twitter and Facebook to communicate with each other and the outside world on what was happening on the island, and news about the terrible events broke on Twitter before any other medium. Social media were also pivotal in establishing the \xe2\x80\x98meet hate with love\xe2\x80\x99 discourse that dominated the Norwegian public sphere in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks (Kverndokk, 2013). For example, peaceful rose parades, organised in all the big cities in Norway on Monday 25 July 2011, were initiated as Facebook events by ordinary citizens. Although some research projects have previously examined aspects of social media activities during the 22 July attack (see, for instance, Eriksson, 2016; Kaufmann, 2015; Kverndokk, 2013; Perng et al., 2012), the RESCUE project is the first research project to carry out a comprehensive analysis of the uses, functions and activities of social media in the context of the attack. The data analysed in the RESCUE project on the 22 July 2011 case consist of: a collection of 2.2 million tweets acquired from Gnip, Twitter\xe2\x80\x99s enterprise API platform, representing the Norwegian Twitter-sphere from 20 July to 28 August 2011 (see Chapter 1 for a further presentation and discussion of this data); qualitative interviews with survivors from Ut\xc3\xb8ya and content from their Facebook accounts (see Frey, 2018 and Chapter 2 in this volume for a further presentation and discussion of this data); qualitative interviews with Norwegian information officers and key communicators in the relevant sectors, and with journalists (see Hornmoen et al., 2018 and Chapter 4 in this volume for a further discussion and presentation of this data); qualitative interviews with journalists who worked on 22 July 2011 (see Konow-Lund & Olsson, 2017 and Chapter 7 for a further presentation and discussion of this data); and content from Norwegian online and print newspapers on 22 and 23 July 2011 (see Ottosen & Bull, 2016; Steensen & Eide, forthcoming 2018, for a further presentation and discussion of this data). Key Findings The findings of the case study of social media activity during and after the 22 July terrorist attacks in Norway are fully presented and discussed in various journal articles, book chapters, and in the chapters of this volume. These publications will be referred to in the following summary of key findings, divided into three sections: (1) findings from the analysis of the Norwegian Twitter-sphere and newspaper content; (2) findings from interviews with survivors from Ut\xc3\xb8ya and (3) findings from interviews with journalists, information officers and other key communicators. Findings from the Analysis of the Norwegian Twitter-sphere The terrorist attacks prompted a 200 per cent increase in Twitter activity in Norway on 22 July 2011; the Norwegian Twitter-sphere was dominated by the event. Hashtags were used to structure and make sense of the otherwise chaotic communication, and the 10 most used hashtags during 22 and 23 July were all related to the attacks, accounting for 60 per cent of all hashtag use over those two days. The most popular hashtags were #prayfornorway, #Ut\xc3\xb8ya and #Oslo, while the hashtag #osloexpl was the most used during the critical hours on 22 July (see Chapter 1 for a further presentation and discussion of these findings). Although hashtags were used more during the critical hours of 22 July (15.25\xe2\x80\x9321.00) than during the following days, less than half the tweets posted in these hours contained hashtags. Furthermore, many of the hashtags used early on were misleading and it took more than 30 minutes after the bomb blast before the Twitter-sphere had established a hashtag (#osloexpl) that made it possible to monitor Twitter appropriately for updates about the crisis situation (see Chapter 1). Given the delay in identifying the perpetrator, the Twitter-sphere was vulnerable to rumour and speculation. In the early phase, rumours about a possible al-Qaida attack circulated in the Norwegian Twitter-sphere, and a large number of tweets blamed radical Muslims. This was, to a certain extent, accompanied by hostility to immigrants and Muslims in general, though this tendency was also criticised by others, warning about a blame game before the facts were on the table (Ottosen, 2015). The Norwegian Twitter-sphere was not dominated by just a few key communicators. The top 10 most active tweeters during the attack only accounted for 4 per cent of all Twitter activity in Norway during the same period; none of the most active tweeters were previously established as public figures. The most active tweeter was a young film critic and journalist, and the Norwegian Twitter-community was dominated by young girls seeking the attention of international pop idols such as Justin Bieber, whose Twitter account was by far the most mentioned both during and after the attacks. Tweets containing the hashtag #prayfornorway and referring to @justinbieber constituted the most common combination of hashtag and reference in the Norwegian Twitter-sphere during and after the attacks (see Chapter 1). As to where the information posted on Twitter came from, Steensen and Eide (forthcoming 2018) found that 14 per cent of all tweets posted between 15.25 on 22 July and 11.00 on 23 July contained hyperlinks, and that more than one-third of these tweets linked to national or international news media. Contents from traditional news media were much more important as sources on Twitter than social media were important as sources for traditional news media. The Norwegian authorities and public bodies were not particularly visible on Twitter during and after the attacks. Of the 8,290 different Norwegian Twitter accounts posting at least one tweet between 15.25 and 21.00 on 22 July, only nine came from public bodies. These nine accounts posted in total 22 tweets during the critical hours; the official account of Oslo Airport was the most active with eight tweets containing updates on how the terrorist attack was affecting traffic to and from the airport. The operating police departments, the Norwegian Security Police (PST), the fire departments or other public emergency offices were absent from Twitter, even though they were mentioned several times by other Twitter users who wanted them to communicate on the social medium. There is, however, one notable exception to this lack of communication on Twitter from public bodies: Oslo University Hospital used Twitter successfully to attract and coordinate blood donors (see Chapters 3 and 4). Findings from Interviews with Survivors from Ut\xc3\xb8ya As part of the case study, eight survivors from Ut\xc3\xb8ya were interviewed in-depth about their social media use and experience prior to, during and after the terrorist attack. All of them were users of social media. Three of them actively used social media during the attack, while some did not even consider using their phones because they were too preoccupied with simply surviving (all findings reported here and later are presented and discussed in Frey, 2018). Facebook was their preferred social medium for contacting their near and dear ones, and for giving and receiving information, especially after the perpetrator had been apprehended by the police. One of the interviewees had a large follower base on Twitter and tweeted information on what was going on during the attack. This interviewee found Twitter more efficient than contacting the police, which she/he also did, but without the sense that they were taking him/her seriously. Another of the interviewees used Facebook to update his/her network about the shootings, and understood from comments that those outside the island were not aware of the extent of the shooting. The active social media users all muted their phones and checked Twitter, Facebook and online news media for updates as a way of acquiring SA. One learned via social media that the shooter was dressed as a policeman, which was important information. Another was told there was only one terrorist, whom she/he later learned had been captured by the police. However, all interviewees told how young people on the island experienced many practical obstacles: their mobile phones were running low on battery power, or they lost their phones when fleeing or swimming. Some were afraid that the terrorist(s) was monitoring social media. Nevertheless, young people on Ut\xc3\xb8ya used Facebook and Twitter to tell outsiders not to call them, afraid that the sound and light of mobile phones ringing could attract the terrorist\xe2\x80\x99s attention. Furthermore, all the interviewees remarked on the difficulty of ascertaining whether something on social media is a rumour or misinformation, when under attack, although one interviewee pointed out that it is possible to verify Twitter accounts. Once rescued, all the interviewees used Facebook to contact friends and family to let them know they were safe. A few also tweeted. In the event of being caught up in another crisis situation, six of the eight would use social media, probably Facebook and Snapchat, or a new, as yet unknown social medium. They stressed that people under attack would benefit from having genuine two-way communication with crisis authorities on social media. Findings from Interviews with Journalists, Information Officers and Other Key Communicators As part of the RESCUE-project, we interviewed key communicators in crisis management organisations (NGOs and public agencies), first responder organisations (fire brigade, police and emergency units), the PST and journalistic institutions. Some of these findings are reported in Hornmoen et al. (2018) and reveal that the key communicators generally see great potential in using social media to create SA and improve management of risks and crises. However, they point to several deficiencies in current uses of social media in emergencies. Interviewees in both crisis management organisations and journalistic institutions point to lack of personnel, problems with organisational routines and coordination and insufficient training. The three groups of communicators differ slightly in their views on what the benefits and challenges of using social media in crises are. Crisis communication managers tend to view dialogical communication as a way of correcting public misconceptions during crisis situations. The first responder communicators largely see postings from social media users as containing potentially vital information, enabling them to act swiftly and effectively in acute situations. The journalist group also sees the potential value of communicating information in their news stories that originates from social media users present at crisis scenes. However, a challenge with social media pointed out by all informants was how to monitor efficiently, and verify, user-generated content during a crisis. Key police and health communicators in government agencies in Norway were also interviewed (see Chapter 4 in this volume) about their use \xe2\x80\x93 or lack of use \xe2\x80\x93 of social media during and after the 22 July attacks. The police interviewees stressed how their unpreparedness in social media use in 2011 alerted them to the urgent need to include social media in their emergency communication. Routines they later established show their recognition of the importance of engaging with social media in daily communication in order to strengthen their public presence and thereby be prepared for effective use of social media in crises. Although police interviewees stress that social media can contribute to saving lives and resolving crises, they do not believe that social media communication would have had any impact on the emergency operations on the island of Ut\xc3\xb8ya. In comparison with the police interviewees, the health communicators we interviewed actually used social media \xe2\x80\x93 particularly Twitter, when the crisis unfolded. However, those health interviewees with different roles and functions in crisis management stressed the need for a better coordination between different actors and agencies in their own sector, and \xe2\x80\x93 equally importantly \xe2\x80\x93 between the different sectors\xe2\x80\x99 emergency services. It is vital that the different emergency services coordinate and strengthen their plans for using social media in crises in order to prevent escalating a crisis through social media use. Konow-Lund and Olsson (2017) interviewed 17 Norwegian journalists a couple of months after the terrorist attacks in 2011 and found that they predominantly used social media as sources of information in line with any other source of information during the crisis. However, as the response to the event moved into a phase of grief and collective sadness, journalists became open to increased audience participation and the potential incorporation of social media use into their coverage. Konow-Lund and Olsson conclude that the journalists were driven by how the public used social media, and that they quickly adapted their professional practice rather than sticking rigidly to their own norms and routines. Recommendations Based on the case study findings presented earlier, we can conclude that: Twitter was an important medium in acquiring SA for at least some of the victims, for the public, and potentially also for the police, other emergency institutions, governmental bodies and public offices during the attacks on 22 July 2011; Key governmental bodies and public offices did not use social media as important sources of information and channels of communication during the attacks. This obstructed proper situation assessment for members of the public and for the authorities themselves, for instance, by allowing rumours and speculation about the identity of the terrorist to flourish and A lack of resources, and social media routines and strategies made it difficult for key communicators in official crisis management and response institutions, to a certain degree also in journalistic institutions, to use the potential of social media as crisis communication tools. In 2011, Facebook and Twitter were the two dominant social media in Norway and elsewhere. Since then, the breadth of social media has increased, and it is today difficult to foresee what social medium will be the most important, or if various groups within the public will turn to different kinds of social media, during future crisis situations. It is, therefore, important for key communicators to understand and master social media monitoring tools and cross-social media features such as hashtags. Furthermore, such tools and features need to be embedded in the routines of everyday professional practice, otherwise they run the risk of being forgotten and seen as conflicting with already established communication routines. Our first recommendation is therefore: Recommendation 1: Acknowledge social media as important and master monitoring and management of features across social media Key communicators and crisis communication institutions should acknowledge that social media are important channels of information dissemination and communication in crisis situations; they should implement social media monitoring tools in their daily communication routines and learn to understand and master cross-social media features like hashtags. As our case study shows, hashtags were an important feature in structuring communication on Twitter during the terrorist attacks. However, it took time for a relevant and much-used hashtag to be established, and the majority of tweets about the attack did not contain hashtags. Eye-witnesses and victims who post important information are not likely to be skilled communicators and therefore might not consider using hashtags. Furthermore, during the first crucial and chaotic minutes after the bomb blast in Oslo, several misleading hashtags were in use. This delay in agreeing on a common hashtag and the lack of hashtag use on Twitter during the attacks might have something to do with the absence of strong communicative leadership in the micro-blogging service and the absence of the authorities and well-known journalists among the top communicators. Even though the Norwegian Twitter-sphere was thematically dominated by the terrorist attacks during 22 and 23 July, it was not dominated by a few, important communicators. The most active tweeters were unexpected actors like a young film critic/journalist, a local politician and several young girls. The victims on Ut\xc3\xb8ya did not know which accounts to follow and who they should direct their social media emergency alerts to. There is, therefore, a need for key communicators in crisis management and response institutions to synchronise their communication and to establish common social media accounts. The authorities in Kenya managed successfully to do exactly that during the Westgate Mall terrorist attack in 2013; they established a standard operating procedure (SOP) to synchronise communication and used WhatsApp for that purpose (Simon, Goldberg, Aharonson-Daniel, Leykin, & Adini, 2014). This leads us to the following four recommendations: Recommendation 2: Synchronise communication and establish a standard operating procedure Official crisis management and response institutions should establish a clear standard operating procedure (SOP) on who communicates what, where and with whom during a crisis, and how communication to and from the various institutions should be synchronised. Recommendation 3: Establish and make known a joint social media emergency account Authorities involved in crisis management and response should have a joint social media emergency account which is well known to the public, similar to emergency numbers like 911 in the US and 112 across the EU countries. Recommendation 4: Participate, interact and take the lead This joint emergency social media account should be active in everyday communication routines, thereby securing a large base of followers; this will enable the account to become a key communicator during crisis situations. Being a key communicator in social media means participation and interaction, and it involves (1) active and rapid communication in all relevant social media; (2) a dialogical approach (involving, for instance, retweets and replies, addressing rumours and false information) towards the audience and (3) taking the lead as quickly as possible in establishing relevant hashtags for all social media communication about the unfolding crisis. Recommendation 5: Be aware of non-hashtagged content Authorities, journalists and other potential key communicators should not base all monitoring of social media content during a crisis on hashtag-based searches only, especially not in the critical minutes after a crisis has occurred. A problem with social media communication during emergencies for all parties involved \xe2\x80\x93 victims, the public, the authorities, NGOs, etc. \xe2\x80\x93 is how to know what information to trust. In our case study, the youngsters at Ut\xc3\xb8ya addressed t",,01-10-2018,,,,,,,,#856,,"",""

Crisis Communication on Twitter: A Social Network Analysis of Christchurch Terrorist Attack in 2019,"","Christchurch terrorist attack is a recent tragedy that happened in New Zealand on 15 March 2019. There are total 50 deaths caused by the attack in Christchurch. In two days, at least, 722,295 tweets are created by users of Twitter, they tweet about their thoughts and prayers about the attack. That means that social media is very important to spread information throughout the world while in a crisis condition, which also able to provide and facilitate how the information flow. To understand the issue, this paper examines the use of Twitter during post-tragedy, which is 2 days after the tragedy happened in New Zealand. The network structures within the conversation about Christchurch attack must be concerned, because many communities and actors play a part in the flow of information about the attack on Twitter.

Digital Communication in Sport Sector: A Brief Analysis of the Pandemic Crisis Period,"","The COVID-19 pandemic changed the general behaviour of the society regarding leisure and entrainment in social media. The pandemic had huge impact in the world of marketing and communications. Sta9rting from the social distance to the lockdown period, the society converted their actions to access and consume content from the different social media channels. Some marketing practitioners argue that making money is critical right now whereas others strongly believe the opposite. The strength of digital and social media communication in times of crisis has been proven in the past and it has been proven during this pandemic as well. During this pandemic we have witnessed similar communication practices that are adapted by the global companies. It became evident that brands must make tough choices affecting customers and develop the right message through right channel while ensuring the honesty and trust in their campaigns. With the uncertainty of next quarter or even next months, brands have had to adjust their marketing budget drastically. Whatever they have planned in the beginning of 2020 was no longer applicable and it leads to quick and sweet adoption of new realities in their communication strategies. Being transparent, supporting local communities and overall focusing on brand awareness rather than product push have been the common practices amongst brands. In addition to successful communication practices, we have also witnessed common pitfalls such as brands communicating the same message without giving any solutions to their customers when it comes to products or services adoption.

First Responders and Crisis Map Symbols: Clarifying Communication,"","During the initial hours of a disaster, first responders enter chaotic, devastated areas to assess the situation and to report information on multiple events back to their command stations. After the tragedies of 9/11 in New York City, the Federal Geographic Data Committee Homeland Security Working Group (FGDC HSWG) proposed universal map symbols for use by all levels of emergency personnel. For map use in a crisis situation, map elements have to be easily understood and interpreted. Therefore, universal symbol sets, especially those that are meant to assist first responders in rescue efforts, should be evaluated using rigorous testing methods. This study explored how human factors research and testing methods can be used by cartographers to improve the design and comprehension of pictorial map symbols. Using the American National Standards Institute's (ANSI) recommended open-ended testing method, this study examined the comprehension of the FGDC HSWG Emergency and Hazard Management Mapping Standards point symbology. Open-ended testing was conducted with 50 firefighters in California using 15 symbols from the Incidents category and 13 symbols from the Operations category.

Crisis Detection in the Age of Digital Communication: The Power of Social Listening as a Method to Identify Corporate Events in Time Series Data,"","The increased usage of digital media to exchange information has increased the speed in which corporate crises become known. This has increased the necessity to react to a crisis as quickly as possible. As a result, social listening \xe2\x80\x93 i.e. listening to and analysing digital communication \xe2\x80\x93 is establishing itself as an instrument for companies to control their own representation in the media. Against this background, different methodological approaches in crisis detection (e.g. outlier detection, t-test and Chow test) were tested regarding their quality. For that, we used a data set created by an AI crawling online sources and analysing the results using a neural network. The findings of this study suggest that crises can be identified quite reliably using existing econometric methods. A simple outlier detection in a time series of the total number of fragments that uses a time frame of one month on each side of a crisis seems to be the best method so far with the method by Chen and Liu being a close second.

Warranted inferences of mediation and possibility of a threshold effect: Verifying the mediating effects of anger in situational crisis communication theory,"","Scholars have called for communication research to verify the causal claims of mediation models from a research design perspective, instead of only proving mediation statistically. This study validates whether and how anger mediates the causal effects of crisis types on publics\xe2\x80\x99 responses in Situational Crisis Communication Theory (SCCT), including reputation, negative word-of-mouth intention, and purchase intention in China. Two experiments were conducted based on the experimental-causal-chain design. Results in Study 1 demonstrate that the causal relationships between three crisis types and publics\xe2\x80\x99 emotional and other responses in China are consistent with findings in Western contexts.

This novel finding suggests the possibility of a threshold effect of anger in the mediating process. Specifically, anger has a mediating effect on publics\xe2\x80\x99 responses when it is below the high-anger threshold. However, anger may no longer be the mediator when it exceeds this threshold. This finding empirically challenges the common assumption that emotions have a linear relationship with publics\xe2\x80\x99 responses, thus offering a new research avenue and deeper understanding of how emotions function in crises.

An Overview of Post-Disaster Emergency Communication Systems in the Future Networks,"","The emerging 5G communication network is gaining tremendous attention from mobile network operators, regulators, and academia due to the provisions of network densification, ultra-low latency and improved spectral and energy efficiencies. However, post-disaster EMS, which nowadays predominantly depends on the wireless communication infrastructure, is significantly lagging behind in terms of innovation, standards, and investments. Since the 5G vision is the revolution of the telecommunication industry, provisions of efficiently handling EMS is expected to be distributed, autonomous, and resilient to the network vulnerabilities due to both manmade and natural disasters. In this article, the 4G LTE approaches for typical post-disaster communication and their shortcomings will be discussed. We elaborate three typical post-disaster network scenarios when the network is congested, partly functional or completely isolated. The possible solution framework, for instance, Device-to-Device communication, drone-assisted communication, mobile ad hoc networks and Internet-of-Things, for post-disaster scenarios will be discussed. Given that spectrum allocation is critical for EMS, we assess the possible schemes for radio resource allocation specific for EMS in addition to the social responsibility of users in such critical situations.",,01-12-2019,,,,,,,,#884,,"",""
Challenges of emergency communication network for disaster response,"","When stricken by a catastrophic natural disaster, the efficiency of disaster response operation is very critical to life saving. However, communication systems, including cellular networks, were usually crashed due to various causes making the coordination among a large number of disorganized disaster response workers extremely difficult. Survival rate can be greatly increased by breaking the communication bottleneck. Based on our firsthand experience in 921 Chi-Chi Earthquake and extensive research, we synthesize a set of requirements for deploying an emergency communication network for disaster response (ECN-DR), which can be deployed and operated under extreme environment and unusually communication behaviors in disaster areas. There are seven challenges, called 7-ability, that have to be addressed when designing an ECN-DR. 7-ability includes popularity, usability, practicability, capacity, reliability, operability and adaptability. Popularity and usability are used to fulfill end-user requirements. Practicability, capacity, reliability, operability and adaptability are used to fulfill operator requirements.

AON: A Survey on Emergency Communication Systems during a Catastrophic Disaster,"","JUNE 2013 Uttarakhand flash-flood killed nearly 5700 people and trapped 110,000. The disaster caused a black-out, leading to a serious network failure which delayed rescue work in isolated areas. The lack of robust communication network has become a sizable topic for scrutiny of disaster inflicted area network system. Thus, it is important to design a network which never fails during such crisis. In this paper, a detailed survey of AONs (Always-On Network) is done and issues in implementation of those are highlighted. The architecture of existing networks has several practical issues in case of emergency which need to be addressed.",,01-01-2017,,,,,,,,#886,,"",""
Emergency Communication in IoT Scenarios by Means of a Transparent LoRaWAN Enhancement,"","This work deals with the management of sporadic and rare events linked with emergency situations in wireless Internet-of-Things (IoT) scenarios. The goal is to increase the performance of the emergency communication, when low-power wide area networks (LPWANs) are used as IoT backbone. In the proposed approach, a device usually operates as a normal node but, in case of emergency, can use the novel LoRa-REP access method. In this work, the LoRa-REP, based on message replication, is discussed focusing on its capability of reducing average transaction time and increasing success probability. Two operational paradigms have been considered and tested: public LoRaWAN infrastructure with cloud-based backend, and private LoRaWAN networks with local backend (edge/fog computing). Typical examples of public networks are smart cities, whereas local networks are often used in industry or building automation. Additionally, two real use cases (for public and local scenarios) are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The experimental results (with a prototype device implementing LoRa-REP and named eNode) show that the success probability of the emergency communication can be increased up to 99.5%, and the average transaction time can be reduced up to 15% with respect to LoRaWAN without retries or up to 50% with respect to LoRaWAN with retries.",,01-10-2020,,,,,,,,#889,,"",""
Optimizing social media message dissemination problem for emergency communication,"","Social media is increasingly being used as a communication bridge between government, emergency responders and managers, and the general public in extreme events. Passing information through social media channels enables individuals to send and receive content in real-time and without limitation of location and geography. While the use of social media in extreme event situations has become prevalent, there is often little strategy involved in message dissemination and too little understanding of the effects that underlying online social networks have on message distribution. In this study, we introduce a formal model for social media message dissemination in social networks through time. Our proposed model includes emphasis on single and multiple message scenarios and examines key communication characteristics in the development of more intentional and targeted social messaging strategies.

Experiment 2 largely replicated these effects and also demonstrated that simple repetition of a message eliminated differences between written and spoken communication. In a final field experiment, chains of participants passed information however they wanted to, with the proviso that half of the chains could not use telephones.

Emergency Communication and Use of ICT in Disaster Management,"","The resilience of communication is of utmost importance at the time of any disaster. Unfortunately, disaster can occur at any time without any prior warning. The recent escalation in the number of natural and/or human-made disasters has ravaged millions of lives and caused billions of dollars in property damage without any discrimination between the developing and the developed countries. Minimizing the effect of such disasters becomes the primary objective. The impact can be mitigated by maintaining a consistent flow of information among locals affected by the disaster. The disaster management organizations are responsible for maintaining situational awareness to assess the damages and needs. Such insights become difficult to source when the communication systems fail, as often seen, in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. The catastrophic collapse of conventional network infrastructure and the failure in establishing real-time emergency communication paradigms restrict disaster salvage (/rescue) efforts, thereby increasing casualty count in a post-disaster scenario. Every region, from any spectrum of development, faces such challenges in the wake of a disaster. These issues beg for the creation of resilient and swiftly deployable communication infrastructure. Furthermore, such an infrastructure should address the data management issues to stave off congestion, optimize bandwidth utilization, and maximize throughput in the network. Here, we survey state of the art in emergency communication technologies for disaster management. Then, we present how these solutions can be applied to create a rapidly deployable network infrastructure for moving toward disaster resilience, further augmented by Information and Communication Technology (ICT). In this scope, we further discuss such infrastructures keeping in mind the deployment conditions like deployment feasibility, infrastructural scalability, and information management capabilities.

Jin et al. explain that the SMCC model has been refined through a series of empirical studies over the past decade, pointing to the need for advanced knowledge on how organizations and publics can harness social media to effectively prepare for and respond to crises, as well as the urgency of understanding the potential dark side of social media and emerging technology. This chapter synthesizes research developing and testing the SMCC model along with related investigations. Jin et al. conclude with recommendations for future research on social media and crisis communication. This chapter provides important details about the SMCC model that should serve as a touchstone for future researchers who utilize the SMCC model in their own crisis communication research.",,25-10-2022,,,,,,,,#960,,"",""
Emergency Communication Application for Speech and Hearing-Impaired Citizens,"","Citizens worldwide with mutism and hearing loss, converse differently than the rest of the population. Preferring a gestural mode of communication, they use sign languages which are established natural languages with an extensive vocabulary and syntax. Nevertheless, despite having equal status to spoken languages, society prominently caters to the majority of citizens who are capable of speaking and processing spoken languages. As a result, sign language speakers face difficulties with social aggregation. The Sri Lankan citizens with mutism and hearing loss obtain improving benefits with the advancement of technology; however, accessing emergency services remains a challenge as they can only be accessed verbally using a phone call. Project `Wadhan' enables citizens with mutism and hearing loss to request for emergency services in real-time without depending on an intermediary. This cross-platform mobile application will convert Sri Lankan Sign Language (SSL) statements to voice and vice-versa, which allows a seamless conversation between the SSL speaker and the emergency operator. The application includes SSL Gesture Recognition, Sinhala Text-to-Speech (TTS), Sinhala Speech Recognition, and SSL Animation Generation, thus resulting in an emergency communication application that can be used by SSL users in dire situations.",,15-12-2020,,,,,,,,#963,,"",""
Disaster Preparedness and the Abeyance of Agency: Christian Responses to Tropical Cyclone Winston in Fiji,"","International practices of disaster preparedness presume human agency, particularly at the household level, as an important pre-emptive response to anticipated natural hazards.

In 2004, the Aceh Provincial Social Service building was one of those affected by the earthquake and tsunami disaster. Many rooms were destroyed, especially the first floor, during the rehabilitation and reconstruction, the Aceh Provincial Social Service building was only repaired on the first floor, so that many rooms on the second floor had cracked floors and even some rooms when someone walked the floor swayed. This makes the staff of the Aceh Provincial Social Service have anxieties about the resilience of the building when thinking about earthquake during work. This study aims to analyze the level of anxiety and preparedness of employees against earthquake disasters, find out the relationship between the variables of anxiety and preparedness, and develop alternative strategies to increase the level of preparedness. The data used in this study uses primary data obtained from observations, interviews, and distributing questionnaires and secondary data obtained through reference books, journals, and the Central Aceh Statistics Agency. Respondents in this study were 68 people. This study uses descriptive qualitative and quantitative methods, regression tests to determine the relationship between the two variables, and SWOT analysis to develop alternative strategies. The results showed that the total score on the level of anxiety possessed by the employees of the Aceh Provincial Social Service was 2,761 in the moderate category, while the total preparedness score was 2,962, which was a high category in facing disaster preparedness. The results of the regression test through ANOVA tables are valued at 0,000 with a 95% confidence level, which means the relationship between the two significant variables has a relationship of 21.9%.

Designing a Relief Distribution Network under Uncertain Situation: Preparedness in Responding to Disaster,"","None can predict a disaster precisely: where, when, and how big a disaster will strike one area. This situation leads to uncertainty in such as required demand and supply availabilities. To an area that has been identified threatening by a natural hazard, a possible disaster scenario may compile. Since time is vital in disaster response operations, developing strategies to speed up emergency response is necessitated. This study is aimed to develop a stochastic model for a location-allocation problem in responding to a forecasted disaster. Our stochastic approach recommends a number and locations of local distribution centers (LDCs) that are required to be set up in the initial stage of the response phase and a number of relief items that will be dispatched to survivors in the affected areas through the proposed relief network. A mixed delivery strategy is applied in a 3-tier of a relief distribution network encompassing warehouses, LDCs, and shelters. This strategy provides the affected people in some of the shelters to receive relief items directly from nearby warehouses, while the remaining shelters will get supplies indirectly through the opened LDCs. Comparing to the indirect strategy that shelters are permitted to receive aid goods only through LDCs, the proposed mixed delivery strategy provides more efficient and effective relief distribution. The probable tsunami in West Sumatra, Indonesia, known as Mentawai Megathrust, is employed to illustrate the developed model. The model will be beneficial for disaster managers to improve the performance of a disaster relief operation.",,28-10-2019,,,,,,,,#995,,"",""
APPLICATION OF DEAGGREGATION OF SPATIAL PROBABILISTIC SEISMIC HAZARD FOR DISASTER PREPAREDNESS,"","For regional disaster prevention, it is important to understand the area of occurrence of strong ground motion and its occurrence probability.

In SPSHA, the results are expressed as a relation between the area where a given seismic intensity is generated and the exceedance probability. Results obtained from such a probabilistic approach include the effects of various seismic sources. Therefore, to efficiently describe an earthquake scenario for regional earthquake countermeasures, it is necessary to understand the impact of each earthquake source. In this study, we propose a seismic hazard deaggregation for SPSHA, and present a method for quantitatively understanding the earthquakes that affect the target region.

"Risk communication, ethics and academic integrity in the process of minimizing the impacts of the covid-19 crisis in Ethiopian higher education","","This study aimed to analyze the commitment, preparedness, response, and challenges of risk communication for the prevention, ethics, and academic integrity of COVID-19 in Ethiopian higher education. Higher education is among those sectors seriously affected by the pandemic and associated factors. Since it appeared in the country, various ethical risk responses have been employed to minimize its impacts. Every commitment, response, preparedness, ethics, academic integrity, and risk communication are efforts to curve the impacts that transcend the globe. The study used an institutional-based cross-sectional study design. Data were collected from primary and secondary sources. These were extracted using web-based research from academic research, preparedness, protocols, standards, and risk communication working papers that were prepared for the Ethiopian context and university media sources. Therefore, a web-based search was used to gather information on the preparedness, commitments, performances, and challenges of Ethiopian higher education. Qualitative thematic analysis was used to explore the experiences of Ethiopian higher education. The findings show that higher education is one of the main task forces that support the national response scheme against the pandemic. The government makes an enormous effort to reduce and minimize its impacts. The findings show that higher education as a task force has contributed strongly to national efforts based on research, ethics, academic integrity, humanitarian assistance, online meetings, e-learning, and conferences. Although research focused on knowledge, attitude, and practice to date there has been no clinical research. Research conducted on COVID-19 by academicians (374 academic staff) of 26 universities focuses on KAPs. Besides, e-learning was poorly and unethically managed to support disrupted education. The postgraduate program was facilitated outside of campus through e-learning which eroded academic integrity. However, e-learning is the weakest and unethical way to support undergraduate and even partially postgraduate programs. The Internet infrastructure and the acculturation of student e-learning are problematic. Furthermore, external pressures such as ethnic conflicts, wars, and fragile political situations are causing the reopening to be delayed. In Ethiopian higher education, the overall effort to communicate risks, ethical education, and academic integrity is minimal. It lacks continuity. It lacks academic integrity. Thus, academic ethics is eroded. The challenges are the remaining homework of the universities.

Based on in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with risk communicators, media workers, and community members, I argue that the differing individual and social experiences of Ebola and cholera in Ghana were shaped by historical, religious, socio-cultural, and institutional processing of risk signals, which guided judgements about risks. This study contributes to the literature on the social amplification of risk framework and risk and crisis communication by showing how the context of an impending crisis can lead to a health crisis for a preventable and treatable disease through the amplification and attenuation of risks signals. The study recommends the inclusion of lay people perspectives in the development of risk and crisis communication campaigns.",,02-08-2020,,,,,,,,#1051,,"",""
Youth Ambassadors for Disaster Preparedness: Using Psychological First Aid in Times of Crisis,"","Abstract Introduction . COVID-19 has been declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. This global disaster has impacted people in various ways, such as the practice of physical distancing and the large-scale social restriction program implemented by the government. This situation of crisis also leads to mental health problems for those who are facing it. Method . We initiated a program with the goal of creating youth ambassadors for disaster preparedness, focusing on the mental health aspect of facing disasters. Nineteen undergraduate students with a psychology background were selected and given proper training on psychological first aid (PFA), which aims to help those affected by this disaster by fostering short and long-term adaptive functioning. Result . The youth ambassador team carried out multiple programs, such as psycho-education webinars held online multiple times. They also gave help to Indonesian students currently studying abroad in Italy in the form of interactive sessions. Discussion . The program gives promising results, with the training enabling the students to function as youth ambassadors and spokesperson on mental health during this disaster, gives them the tools they need to help others in the form of PFA. The training module could be implemented further to create more ambassadors working for this cause.",,01-02-2021,,,,,,,,#1052,,"",""

"Communication in Crisis. The ""Red Phone"" and the ""Hotline""","","In situations of crisis politicians are expected to keep calm and to de-escalate the state of affairs. In this paper I will discuss two devices for crisis communication with regard to form and behaviour: First, the legendary Red Phone as a direct communication link between Washington and Moscow, which allows the president to present himself as a capable leader with a cool mind, who can pick up the Red Phone and convince a political opponent in a crisis. Second, the Hotline as a highly formalised telex connection between both capitals, which enables the political leaders of the US and the USSR to communicate quickly and reliably but without capitalising on the abilities of the president as a cool-headed negotiator. The aim of this analysis is to discuss how both devices were presented to the public and used by the politicians and how this may impact on national and international politics.",,01-05-2010,,,,,,,,#1060,,"",""

Information and Communication Technology in Crisis and Disaster Management,"","Information and communication technologies (ICTs) cover a wide range of telecommunication devices and applications, which facilitate the flow of information. Within crisis and disaster management, these devices and applications may be used explicitly for hazards or crisis detection, information management, communication, situational awareness, search and rescue efforts, and decision support systems. Everything from cell phones and social media to unmanned aerial vehicles and weather stations are used to collect, disseminate, and monitor various types of information and data to provide a common operating picture. ICTs are continually evolving, with new features developed and deployed at a rapid pace. This development has had a unique impact on crisis and disaster management, allowing for real-time communication and situational awareness, as well as novel approaches to simulations and training. With the near-ubiquitous use of some devices, information is also no longer held solely by government or private sector officials; ordinary citizens are also able to contribute to and disseminate information during and after crises. For some segments of the population, this ability to meaningfully contribute is not only empowering but necessary to highlight unmet needs. Throughout the evolution of ICTs, new research and practical concerns have highlighted persistent unmet needs of more vulnerable populations due to growing interdependence and integration across jurisdictional boundaries worldwide. The continued expansion of ICTs will most likely have a profound impact on this field in the future.",,30-10-2019,,,,,,,,#1063,,"",""

COMMUNITY EDUCATION AS A TOOL FOR BUILDING ITS RESILIENCE IN DISASTER PREPAREDNESS,"","Every day, the community faces various disasters: from minor thefts, traffic accidents, floods, prolonged droughts, to terrorism or cyber-attacks. However, coping with one disaster assumes that the community can better prepare to cope with another disaster in the future. Residents have the right to assistance from the state, but at the same time they have a duty and coresponsibility for their protection. Therefore, nowadays there is a need to focus more on community education and to ensure the functioning of this community during local disasters without relying on state assistance. Community education can play an important role in preparing, dealing with, and reducing the negative impacts of disasters. The main reason for enlightening and educating the community is its own increase in resilience and reduction of vulnerability at the local level, with an emphasis on socially vulnerable groups. Furthermore, the level of education improves the socio-economic status and thanks to this it is possible to better prepare (funds, insurance, and quality housing) for local threats. In addition, these people may have better communication links and thus have much better access to quality and relevant information.

Tourism Disaster Preparedness Post-COVID-19 Pandemic: The Example of Argentina,"","Purpose: The present chapter includes discussing the effects of COVID-19 in the tourism industry. Although much has been written on COVID-19 in these days, literature emphasizes on the economic devastating consequences of lockdown on tourism industry. The chapter goes in an opposite direction revealing the fears, expectance, and hopes of tourism staff in Argentina. Design-Methodology: Because of the methodological impossibilities to conduct face-to-face interviews, we have employed digital platform to conduct 50 interviews in tourism professionals geographically located in different Argentinean cities as well as coming from different subsectors in the tourism industry. The used method was snowball which means that each interviewee recommended another one once the interview ends. The sample was drawn in 20 females and 30 males from 25 to 55 years old. Findings: The findings suggest three important assumptions. Interviewees expressed some partisan or ideological hostilities against China and Eastern countries. The Chinese tourists were seen with some mistrust for interviewed people as well as the reaction of Chinese government to stop the pandemic. In other cases, old inter-class rivalries were found when interviewees blamed the stranded (rich) tourists as the main carriers of the virus in Argentina-wide. Hostilities and chauvinist expression against neighboring countries such Bolivia or Chile were overtly uttered. These narratives escalate when interviewees manifest their wages have been unilaterally slumped down. By the side, digital technologies offer as fertile ground to exploit new forms of tourism in the years to come. Research Limitations: The obtained outcome should be validated in next approaches because the sample is not statistically representative of the universe. The restrictions imposed by the lockdown impeded further research today. In the same line, the sample was limited to tourism professionals, which suggests that policymakers should be included in the future research. Practical Implications: Understanding the fears and hope of tourism staff is an alternative way to enact sustainable policies to mitigate the negative effects of the pandemic in the tourism industry. While these policies construct a bridge between theory and management, no less true is that the future of tourism remains uncertain. Originality Value: The present chapter provides an original empirical insight into the viewpoint of tourism staff, which is today subject to countless fears and deprivations.

Communication barrier-incorporated network modeling for interorganizational opinion formation in emergency events,"","During and after an emergency event, multiple organizations with various specialties are involved in consensus decision-making to reduce the loss of lives and property in a timely manner. However, timely, high-consensus decision-making is challenging due to communication barriers between participating organizations. Thus, this study generalizes a conceptual communication network considering communication barriers by reviewing multiple historical emergencies and proposes a quantitative communication network model by integrating an opinion dynamics model and social network analysis (SNA). An illustrative example is provided by simulating two emergency decision-making scenarios to verify the proposed model. A case study of the 2013 Qingdao oil pipeline explosion is presented to demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of the proposed model. The results of the case study indicate that the proposed model can accurately quantify the impact of communication barriers on the opinion formation time.

Emergency Medical Services Communication Barriers and the Deaf American Sign Language User,"","Objective: We sought to identify current Emergency Medical Services (EMS) practitioner comfort levels and communication strategies when caring for the Deaf American Sign Language (ASL) user. Additionally, we created and evaluated the effect of an educational intervention and visual communication tool on EMS practitioner comfort levels and communication. Methods: This was a descriptive study assessing communication barriers at baseline and after the implementation of a novel educational intervention with cross-sectional surveys conducted at three time points (pre-, immediate-post, and three months post-intervention). Descriptive statistics characterized the study sample and we quantified responses from the baseline survey and both post-intervention surveys. Results: There were 148 EMS practitioners who responded to the baseline survey. The majority of participants (74%; 109/148) previously responded to a 9-1-1 call for a Deaf patient and 24% (35/148) reported previous training regarding the Deaf community. The majority felt that important details were lost during communication (83%; 90/109), reported that the Deaf patient appeared frustrated during an encounter (72%; 78/109), and felt that communication limited patient care (67%; 73/109). When interacting with a Deaf person, the most common communication strategies included written text (90%; 98/109), friend/family member (90%; 98/109), lip reading (55%; 60/109), and spoken English (50%; 55/109). Immediately after the training, most participants reported that the educational training expanded their knowledge of Deaf culture (93%; 126/135), communication strategies to use (93%; 125/135), and common pitfalls to avoid (96%; 129/135) when caring for Deaf patients. At 3 months, all participants (100%, 79/79) reported that the educational module was helpful. Some participants (19%, 15/79) also reported using the communication tool with other non-English speaking patients. Conclusions: The majority of EMS practitioners reported difficulty communicating with Deaf ASL users and acknowledged a sense of patient frustration. Nearly all participants felt the educational training was beneficial and clinically relevant; three months later, all participants found it to still be helpful. Additionally, the communication tool may be applicable to other populations that use English as a second language.",,21-06-2021,,,,,,,,#1149,,"",""

Emergency Information Communication Structure by Using Multimodel Fusion and Artificial Intelligence Algorithm,"","With the development of The Times, social events are increasing, and emergency management has gradually become the main helper to solve the crisis in the public domain. By observing the current situation of many countries and regions, we can find that various types of public crises often occur in many countries and regions in the world, which have severely affected people's daily life, lives, and property. Through long-term research and analysis, it can be known that the emergency management mechanism currently established in China has certain shortcomings. The communication problem of emergency information is likely to cause the emergency work to not proceed smoothly. In addition, problems in the communication channels of emergency information are likely to cause problems in the cooperation of various departments when people carry out emergency management work, and the efficiency of the government in dealing with problems will also be reduced in real scenarios. In order to improve the efficiency of emergency information management, this paper aims at the various problems existing and facing in the construction of emergency management system. On this basis, the integration of various relevant emergency information management plan models is analyzed and sorted out, and based on the research and integration of the development of artificial intelligence algorithms. The main research results of emergency information management at home and abroad are comprehensively studied and evaluated. Finally, a QG algorithm based on more model fusion is developed. In the process of analysis, this article uses artificial intelligence algorithms to build a prediction model of multiple modes and collects the data needed to build the model by random extraction. Through the analysis of different data sets, it is used as the basic training data for prediction.

Towards impact-based communication during emergencies: Development of site-specific warning services in Catalonia,"","&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Early warning systems are a critical element for flood risk reduction. If properly designed and disseminated, flood warnings can empower citizens and communities at risk by enhancing their preparedness and their response capacity during a flood event to reduce the possibility of personal injury or loss of life. Nevertheless, the reported situations where citizens did not react to warnings keep increasing, regardless if timely warnings were issued in the area. Receiving an official flood warning is not enough to guarantee appropriate proactive responses and self-protective behaviours from citizens during weather-related emergencies.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Flood warnings should aim to communicate clear and relevant local information on how floods might have an impact on citizens and what actions they can do to ensure their safety. Site-Specific Warnings (SSWs) are proposed as a step towards impact-based communication for citizens during weather-related emergencies.&amp;amp;#160; The SSWs aim to translate meteorological and hydrological hazards into location-specific impacts and thus, propose appropriate local self-protection actions using local vulnerability and exposure information.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In this work, a prototype of SSWs has been developed for previously defined vulnerable points in the city of Blanes, Spain.

"Disaster resilience through the lens of administrative and social media data: preparedness, response, and recovery","","With the growing consequences of climate change, the frequency and magnitude of disasters are rapidly increasing. In addition, in the twenty-first century, pandemics have become increasingly common and complicated all across the world. Consequently, social resilience has become more and more important in response to the social ramifications of these events. The reactions of community members to disasters, including specific behavioral patterns, vary depending on many factors, including the type of the events. These differences can be observed from the form and intensity of interactions among the community members - to the speed and quality of recovery and the bounce-back process, also referred to as social resilience. Social resilience is ""the ability of social entities to endure, absorb, manage, and adjust to various kinds of threats."" (Aldrich &amp; Meyer, 2015; Berkes &amp; Ross, 2013; Hutter et al., 2013)The diversity of types of destructive and life-threatening disasters means that communities are facing a wide range of different kinds of threats. How communities respond varies by community. Therefore, the nature and implications of the disasters, including communities' preparedness, response, and recovery processes, need to be studied through perspectives that capture both those communities' characteristics as well as the disasters'. Administrative data resources provide an opportunity to study the effects of different disasters as well as how the community responds. Social media data provides another source of information about disasters that can help policy makers be more situationally aware, leading to better decision-making before, during, and after a catastrophe. Given that the use of social media is widespread, particularly during disruptive events, analysis of this data can be especially valuable. Nowadays, data and policy are quite entangled and have a reciprocal interaction. Using big data sources in disaster policy making can uncover major inefficiencies in disaster preparedness, leads to improvement strategies for constituent-government engagement in disaster mitigation, or building automated resilience tool derived from real-time, naturally occurring social media data. This dissertation research uses both administrative and social media data to illustrate disaster resilience in selected Massachusetts' communities.

The districts targeted were 17 and the respondents were district disaster management personnel, in the office of the Chief Administrative Officer, local council members who are the legislators, district disaster management committees and representatives from the community. The results indicated that there is poor capacity on the part of staff in understanding the key standards that relate to disaster responsiveness. The personnel holding these portfolios are not well trained to handle emergency response. 89% of the districts covered had no facilities to evacuate the vulnerable in case of a disaster. However, planning is done at district level and this creates plans for emergencies that have localized dimensions. Resource utilization for disaster preparedness activities can be incorporated in the other plans using locally generated resources.

Online Communication by Emergency Responders during Crisis Events,"","Social media have become critical components of all phases of crisis management, including preparedness, response, and recovery. Numerous recent events have demonstrated that during extreme occurrences (such as natural hazards, civil unrest, and domestic terrorist attacks), social media platforms are appropriated for response activities, providing new infrastructure for official responders to disseminate event-related information, interact with members of the public, and monitor public opinion. Emergency responders recognize the potential of social media platforms and actively use these technologies to share information and connect with constituents; however, many questions remain about the effectiveness of social media platforms in reaching members of the public during times of crisis.

Wide use of voice messages confirmed whether family members and relatives remained safe, and satellite phones played a crucial role in emergency communication during the response stage. Social media also played an extensive role in both search and rescue and fundraising. Reducing telephone network congestion requires the expansion of packet communications and emergency message services, as well as backup systems, with storage of batteries and generators with enough fuel in higher locations to avoid flooding. Social media and FM radio have played a crucial role in providing information to local communities, so city and local governments should use both for regular communication in order to enhance their effectiveness during emergencies.

A renewed awareness: Reinvigorating preparedness research for crisis and disaster management,"","In the summer of 2023, a vast array of disasters and devastating fires reaped havoc around the globe. Extreme weather dominated headlines for weeks. A deadly blaze ripped through the island of Maui, Hawaii, engulfing entire landscapes and catching communities off guard. The death toll has risen to 114, and more than 1000 people remain missing at the time of writing. Hawaii was not the only tragedy, however. In Algeria, huge wildfires cost the lives of 34 people and left over 200 wounded, as the fire raged across forests, villages and small towns in the mountainous north of the country. Multiple fires raged across Greece, threatening Athens and the Island of Rhodes during the longest heat-wave in the country so far. On the Canary Island of Tenerife, fire crews struggled to contain one of the largest wildfires in its history. In Canada, as well, over 20,000 habitants of the provincial capital city Yellowknife were summoned to evacuate as incoming wildfires raged out of control. As if this was not enough, wildfires were not the only hazard that impacted communities in the summer of 2023. Unprecedented storms raged across Scandinavia for days, resulting in extensive flooding across Norway, Sweden and Denmark. Likewise, Hurricane Hillary battered the US west coast, confronting communities with a major hurricane for the first time in over 80 years. Indeed, the summer of 2023 reminded us that a changing climate can have brutal consequences. The worrisome part is that in all of these cases, the natural hazards seem to take place on a larger scale and more frequently than expected. The summer of 2023 surprised climate scientists by the magnitude and severity of the natural hazards. It is a worrisome observation that warrants a response. What can we do to prevent or mitigate the impact of these events, and prepare ourselves for future occurrences? It is a question often posed in the aftermath of catastrophes, and one that has fueled research into disaster preparedness for decades. In this editorial, we take a closer look into a bundle of four papers about disaster preparedness that together make up the September issue of Risk, Hazards and Crisis in Public Policy. Each of the four papers provides a unique perspective on preparedness research that helps to reinvigorate the academic debate on this important topic. In our review of 20 years of crisis and disaster research (Wolbers et al., 2021), disaster preparedness, next to crisis response, ranked as one of the most frequently researched topics in our field. Research into preparedness focuses on the use of knowledge, experience and technological advances to systematically and consciously gain ever-more-encompassing protection from natural and human hazards, disasters, and calamities (Tierney et al., 2001: 4\xe2\x88\x928). As we argued above, the very idea of preparedness often comes with a sense of urgency that we need to act now to prevent future harm. Contingencies that require preparedness are often true magnets of attention in the public debate and are often translated directly into renewed plans and exercises (Heino & Huotari, 2023). Indeed, research into preparedness has documented that preparedness tends to increase after communities are affected by disaster (Kapucu, 2008). This is also what Nikkanen et al. (2023) find in their contribution to this issue. The authors investigated what drives the feeling of responsibility for disaster preparedness between individuals and society in a large-scale survey. They compared the disaster-prone country of New Zealand with Finland, which experiences much fewer disasters. The authors find that self-efficacy strongly predicts the perception of responsibility and actual preparedness measures. Doing so, the study echoes past research that preparedness is strongly related to previous experience with hazards. The historical and societal context shapes the individual's feelings of responsibility for disaster preparedness, while the authors note that self-efficacy remains the most salient factor in empowering individuals to take responsibility. Despite the call for self-efficacy, we also know that memory of past events is short-lived, and preparedness efforts ease-off over time. Most people in disaster prone regions know they should prepare, but very few actually do (Kapucu, 2008). Notwithstanding, the long shadow casted by a calamity often drives the incentive for politicians and policymakers to make sure this will never happen again. This type of reaction poses the risk that disaster preparedness becomes reactive and narrow, merely based on past events. To step up preparedness policies, we might be better off assessing generic risks and preparing for a broad set of contingencies, instead of letting the recent past guide our efforts in a specific direction. This is the point that, Heino and Huotari (2023) bring forward in their paper: \xe2\x80\x9cHow considering memory as an analogy to preparedness reveals its weaknesses.\xe2\x80\x9d They claim that while disaster preparedness is shaped by our current conceptions of what might occur, threats that fully escape our attention pose a true and invisible danger to us. Figuring out what these threats are and how they might affect us, requires a renewed toolkit. Heino and Huotari (2023) identify analogies as a helpful tool for this task to systematically analyze the presumptions underpinning our conception of risk and vulnerabilities. They point out that we often group knowledge together instead of remembering lots of pieces of information when we attempt to remember critical information, and likewise treat distinct vulnerabilities as if they belong to equivalent categories. Categorization plays a key role here, which has received scarce attention in preparedness research. Being more sensitive to categorization might help to identify vulnerabilities that have escaped our attention. Heino and Huotari (2023) claim that the challenge is to find ways to systematically cast light on the categorization of vulnerabilities. Progress lies in enhancing the power of imagination as a disciplined approach to reflective practice (Weick, 1989). How real this fallacy of letting lessons from past events fully absorb professional attention and determine the sphere of practical solutions, becomes clear in the contribution from R\xc3\xa4is\xc3\xa4nen et al. (2023). The authors analyze pandemic preparedness among Finnish infectious disease experts before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. They show that the initial conceptualization of COVID-19 was based on the historical analogy of an influenza type disease. Like many experts around the world, also for Finnish crisis managers this conceptualization limited them in grasping the extent of the crisis. The influenza analogy shaped the initial response, but over time experts stressed the need for a comprehensive risk assessment. They had overlooked the extent of transboundary crisis management capacities that were required to secure long-term response efforts. Interestingly, when writing our review of pandemic publishing (Kuipers et al., 2022), we noted a similar absence for more generic preparedness in research on epidemics and pandemics, as public health scholars were inclined to focus more on the particularities of specific diseases. Using the power of imagination to identify what unidentified hazards might impact our society, is something that Louis-Charles et al. (2023) take very literally. In their paper, they conduct an empirical analysis on the probability of civilian casualties from rocket launch anomalies, or from falling space debris. This study provides a glimpse into how emergency managers incorporate new types of hazards in their preparedness plans. While a significant number of documents mention falling aircrafts, missiles from tornadoes and weapons of mass destruction, human-made or unknown space hazards remain outside the scope of imaginability in local emergency management plans, even in counties near space launch sites. We hope you are inspired by these contributions in the latest issue of Risk, Hazards & Crisis in Public Policy. These studies remind us that in many cases, we might never know whether prevention and preparedness efforts boosted community resilience. The ultimate proof only comes when the next natural hazard strikes, and preparedness and mitigation efforts prevent it from turning into a full-blown disaster. Ironically, successful prevention is invisible and meanwhile it is hard to prepare for the unknown. If anything, the summer of 2023 again taught us that in terms of preparedness: \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no harm in hoping for the best, as long as you're prepared for the worst.\xe2\x80\x9d Jeroen Wolbers is Editor-in-Chief of Risk, Hazards & Crisis in Public Policy.

Covid-19 Disaster: Interdependence of Crisis Communication and Socio-Economic Resilience,"","When the General Assembly adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development it emphasized the principle of \xe2\x80\x98leaving no one behind\xe2\x80\x99. Then onwards, countries designed programmes on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) around a holistic, inclusive and transdisciplinary approach which was based on harmony and partnership. The current fear of Coronavirus transmission has derailed this approach. Media has always been a partner and an accelerator to governance in normal as well as in crisis times. Covid-19, a fatally contagious disease that has spread into hundreds of countries cutting across geographical boundaries, killing over four hundred thousand people in about six months, largely remains an enigma for governments, medical fraternity and disease control organizations. This disease exposes the fragile public health infrastructure and preparedness in both rich and poor nations. Media and communication are important parts of every disaster management, both from the perspective of authorities in charge of managing the crisis who have to keep people informed and independent media that by its very nature is probing and questioning, seeking accountability. There is a debate within the media itself on \xe2\x80\x98independent vs. embedded\xe2\x80\x99 discourse. During a crisis situation, information emerging from various players ends up as a complex web of communication. The current paper analyzes the Covid-19 crisis through the lens of communication and media capturing various glimpses to discuss how the crisis is being managed. Covid crisis has affected the media like any other industry with dwindling revenues and loss of jobs. The print media in particular is facing the existentialist crisis and this paper attempts to explore possible solutions which have been discussed in the paper.",,01-01-2020,,,,,,,,#1229,,"",""
The role of communication in emergency evacuations: An analysis of a ring network with a static disruption,"","Whilst technology has advanced rapidly over the last few decades, emergency evacuation procedures have not kept up-to-date with this technological progress. This paper explores the benefits of information and communication for agents in a simple ring network. The majority of the existing literature focuses on using agent-based simulation models to predict outcomes. One of the major benefits of this technique is that it allows the incorporation of many different factors that drive evacuation outcomes; however, simulation-only techniques lack power when attempting to explain the relationship between these factors. This paper provides an analytical framework to derive closed-form solutions for the relationship between the distance travelled to evacuate, the size of the network, the number of agents in the network, the level of information available and the communication broadcast range. Performance is measured using average distances travelled and worst-case analysis.",,01-10-2014,,,,,,,,#1230,,"",""
Understanding the role of individual- and community-based resources in disaster preparedness,"","Standard emergency-management practice in the U.S measures disaster preparedness as an individual household attribute based on amounts of stocked supplies, hazard mitigation actions, and emergency planning. Such measures generally fail to consider how norms of trust, fairness, and reciprocity, as well as networks of social relationships\xe2\x80\x94that is, social capital\xe2\x80\x94can facilitate coordination and enable sharing and communal action in the face of disaster. Our study assesses how shared resources, social capital, and day-to-day resources (specifically, food and water) could influence earthquake disaster preparedness across different communities. Using Seattle as the site of investigation, the study involved in a split-ballot experiment embedded in a mail survey of a random sample of households. These households were stratified by zip codes selected for their contrasting demographics (N = 1340). Half of the households in each zip code answered conventional individualistic measures of disaster preparedness, while the other half answered questions regarding resources they, their family, friends, and neighbors might share. In racial-majority-dominated zip codes, reported preparedness was higher when people were asked to consider shared resources. Disaster preparedness also appeared to be underestimated with the traditional measure. Households with greater bridging social capital (connections with individuals who are similar in social identity but have different interests) and longer neighborhood tenure also reported higher preparedness. Our findings suggest disaster preparedness efforts should focus on supplementing individual preparedness with daily resources, social capital, and collective shareable community assets\xe2\x80\x93 a focus that we call \xe2\x80\x9cmainstreaming.\xe2\x80\x9d",,01-10-2023,,,,,,,,#1232,,"",""

Does Wildfire Exposure Influence Corporate Disaster Preparedness? A Study of Natural Resources Extraction Firms in Canada,"","Managers must make critical disaster preparation decisions to protect firm assets from the threat of wildfire activity. Prior literature stresses the importance of past disaster experience as a key driver of disaster preparation. The article finds that, while experience with disasters is a critical condition, it is insufficient to explain disaster preparation activities by firms. Managerial perceptions including belief in anthropogenic climate change and the perception of increasing wildfires can substitute for direct negative wildfire experience. The article builds configural theory to explain how the psychological \xe2\x80\x9ccloseness\xe2\x80\x9d of wildfire hazards can influence managerial decisions to prepare for disasters in the presence of key organizational characteristics. This study adopts a qualitative comparative analytical approach, drawing on manager surveys and biophysical wildfire data from 20 Canadian mining and resource extraction sites. The article also contrasts manager perceptions of wildfire risk with those of experts and captures a gap in risk perception.",,17-10-2023,,,,,,,,#1235,,"",""
Forecaster and Emergency Manager Perspectives on Coordination and Communication with the Weather-Warned Public,"","According to the National Weather Service, each year the United States experiences an average of 1,200 tornadoes that kill about sixty people and injure about 1,500. The goal of this work is to explore the warning communication process from the perspectives of the forecaster (National Weather Service) and the responder (emergency management agencies) and to identify variations and challenges in communication strategies. This research explores the priorities, perceptions, perspectives, and challenges these professionals face and identifies any variations among regions and between professions. Through two different national surveys, these professionals provide insight into the realities of disseminating warnings and meeting particular needs of the communities they serve. This work further examines the perceptions professionals have of weather understanding by the public. Tornado risk and warnings are the primary focus of this work. Findings reveal that forecasters and emergency managers lack confidence that the public understands warnings and watches. This study also found consistency in the frequency and nature of interaction between National Weather Service Forecast Offices and the communities they serve and regional variations were observed in the interactions between emergency managers and the communities they serve.",,03-04-2017,,,,,,,,#1239,,"",""
Professional Perspectives on the Use of a Crisis Communication Plan,"","A standout amongst the most significant concerns for PR practitioners is the need to have a crisis communication plan. It is crucial for a company to preserve its image and reputation, and a PR practitioner plays vital role in accomplishing this goal but this cannot be accomplished if PR professionals do not have a tool to handle crisis. A crisis communication goes beyond just communicating with the publics but it helps in protecting the image and reputation of the affected organization. This paper seeks to find out how PR practitioners engage a crisis communication plan during a crisis and how necessary it is to always have a plan. To achieve this, survey research design was adopted with the use of questionnaire as instrument for data collection. These copies of questionnaires were distributed to five PR agencies in Lagos state and were strictly filled by PR practitioners. This was to enable the researcher achieve the main purpose for the research which is getting the views of PR practitioners in using a crisis communication plan. The findings show that although PR practitioners handle crisis, they do not have a plan ready to tackle crisis. They rather wait for crisis to first happen before they come up with a plan. Another major finding is that these PR practitioners after implementing a plan, do not evaluate if the plan was successful or not.",,13-10-2020,,,,,,,,#1240,,"",""
Meteorological Indigenous Knowledge Systems for Prediction of Rainfall in the Chimanimani District of Zimbabwe and Potential for Community Disaster Preparedness,"","The paper focuses on indigenous knowledge systems (IKS) which people of Chimanimani District of Zimbabwe use to predict rainfall patterns. This is based on a 2019 socio-ecological study conducted in the district. The main objective of the study was to establish the extent of use and efficacy of meteorological IKS for prediction of rainfall in Chimanimani and to explore potential contribution of the meteorological IKS in local community disaster preparedness. The study came at the backdrop of a trail of unprecedented human and environmental destruction that occurred in the district following the devastating Cyclone Idai of April of 2019. Despite the existence of IKS and modern weather forecasting tools, the Cyclone seemed to have caught both the community and government unprepared, prompting this study. In depth-interviews and storytelling were conducted with traditional leaders and community elders. A qualitative approach was applied through the use of detailed interviews and focus group discussion to collect meteorological IKS from three communities in the district. Thematic analysis anchored in the interpretive and ontological paradigms was utilized within the realism theory. The meteorological IKS found in the study were classified into five interpretive categories namely vegetation, animals, birds, insects and cosmology. The study concluded that meteorological IKS are no longer widely used due to a number of factors including inferioritisation and limited documentation. It was noted that the IKS have potential for incorporation into the community disaster preparedness frameworks.",,01-01-2020,,,,,,,,#1242,,"",""
Crisis Communication in China: Strategies taken by the Chinese Government and Online Public Opinion,"","Crisis communication strategies play an important role in determining whether an organisation is able to survive a crisis affecting the public. The 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, outbreak in China is considered the beginning of modern crisis management and communication in the country. Ten years later, when a similar public health crisis occurred in 2013 with the H7N9 outbreak, the Chinese government pursued a variety of strategies to avoid a potential pandemic. Much of the previous research on crisis communication in China adopted Coombs\xe2\x80\x99 Situational Crisis Communication Theory. However, as a theory proposed and developed in the West, its application in a non-Western culture requires testing. In addition, cultural influences and the role of digital technology have been discussed in some existing literature, but few studies have attempted to integrate these elements into crisis communication theories.In order to fill these two gaps, this research analyses the Chinese government\xe2\x80\x99s crisis communication strategies during the H7N9 crisis, examining not only the government\xe2\x80\x99s management of the crisis but also the public\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to the official communication process. It also explores the cultural context and the development of digital media as critical actors underlying the strategies adopted. The analysis contributes to development of a comprehensive theory that incorporates these two elements, which shows and identifies related crisis communication strategies emerged from cultural traditions and the development of digital media. This research analyses five media sources representing different perspectives \xe2\x80\x93 government newspaper reports, press conferences and Weibo posts representing the government perspective and metropolitan newspaper reports and public Weibo posts representing public perspective. It aims to identify the strategies taken by the Chinese government during the H7N9 crisis and to examine the role of cultural factors and digital technology. This research uses the case study method and includes content analysis and critical discourse analysis. Content analysis is used to describe patterns and trends in strategies used during the H7N9 crisis, as represented in the government media sources. Critical discourse analysis is used for in-depth analysis of press conference transcripts to identify cultural factors relevant to the crisis communication strategies. Content analysis of metro newspapers reports and public Weibo posts, as well as critical discourse analysis of public Weibo postings are conducted to examine how the public responded to the strategies taken by the Chinese government.",,02-12-2020,,,,,,,,#1243,,"",""
